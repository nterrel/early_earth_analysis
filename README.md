Usage and some notes:

* Parquets:
    alanine_df.pq : split merged_mol.pq to only include the found alanine molecules
    largest_frame.pq: frame 24221, from 0.3 ns .dcd file -- includes 41 molecules (the most found in any specific frame)

* _broken_scripts, _broken_extracts primarily contain things that did not work, but may also include things that are no longer necessary due to updated methods



** THIS NEEDS UPDATING FOR WHAT I'VE WORKED ON RECENTLY
