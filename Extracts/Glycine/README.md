# WIP: Glycines are the last frontier of the early earth data
- There are approx 5 million graphs that 'matched' the standard glycine
    - Note that many of these are probably not really glycines due to the non-specificity of nodes-edges in the graph matching used
- Saved this data for last since I couldn't figure out the multiprocessing extraction process
