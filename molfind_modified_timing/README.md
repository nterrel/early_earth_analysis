# Directory to keep track of timing after changing molfind analysis program

* Only significant change thus far is the addition of a more rigorous graph comparison.

* Tried changing lots of things (adding atom indices to formula parquet, for example) and ruined the performance of the program. So those are in a branch that I no longer touch and I am trying to change one thing at a time, test every change for efficiency.
