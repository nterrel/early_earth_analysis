# Some scripts that have limited utility, but may contain some useful snippets

`last_frame.py` is a script used for isolating a single frame from a trajectory

`dcd_mapping.py` is used to determine timestamps -- since i ran this once there should be a parquet with all the correct timestamped filenames in `/red/roitberg/nick_analysis`.
