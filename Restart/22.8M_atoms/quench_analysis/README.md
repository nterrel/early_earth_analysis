# Analysis of the quenched simulation runs

## NOTE: There are three frames missing from the quenched files -- corresponding to the three traj that hit neighborlist memory errors while running, the following jobIDs: 43825345, 43776685, 43825322

* Figure out which frames those three correspond to and drop them from the 'original' dataframes.
